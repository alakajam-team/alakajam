Welcome!
## About this site
<img src="/static/images/docs/play.png" class="pull-right" width="26%" />Alakajam! is a young community gathering game development enthusiasts from all backgrounds. We host a series of informal events, that give you a chance to both make games *and* get people to play them:

* **Alakajam!** competitions, taking place over a week-end, three times a year. Start/end times are suited to European timezones.
* **Kajam!** month-long events, inviting people to learn and experiment around a specific topic.
* And finally **Tournaments** where everyone can compete on the games we made!

Sounds exciting? Come join us! You can start by making an account [in a few clicks](/register), then check the home page or the [Events](/events) to learn the date of the next jam. Feel free to introduce yourself [with a blog post](/post/create)!

If you want to give a hand to our little community, check the [contributing page](/article/contributing).
